# Invoice OCR Project

created by Anna Dudek @Anna-portfolio

A modular pipeline for preprocessing scanned documents and classifying their type (invoice, contract, ID card, etc.).
The current version uses a PyTorch model for testing the end-to-end workflow.

#Preprocessing Pipeline
The preprocessing module applies several operations to normalize image quality before classification:
Denoising – removes image noise
Gamma correction – normalizes exposure
CLAHE – boosts local contrast
Linear brightening – additional brightness adjustment
Deskew (Hough Transform) – fixes rotation/skew
Orientation normalization – rotates documents by ±90° or 180° if required

This produces a high-quality, normalized image suitable for classification or OCR.

# Usage

def run():
    # 1. Paths
    raw_image = "data/raw/invoice_original.png"
    preprocessed_image = "data/processed/invoice_preprocessed.png"
    model_path = "models/document_classifier.pt"

    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(preprocessed_image), exist_ok=True)

    # 1. Preprocessing
    processed = preprocess_invoice_pipeline(
        image_path=raw_image,
        output_path=preprocessed_image
    )

    # 2. Classification
    result = classify_document(
        image_path=preprocessed_image,
        model_path=model_path
    )

    # 3. Result
    print("Prediction result:", result)
